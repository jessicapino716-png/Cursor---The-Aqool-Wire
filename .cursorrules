I am the Non-Technical Founder/CEO of 'The Aqool Wire'.
The Project: A "Bloomberg Terminal" for Saudi Arabia's AI Ecosystem.
The Stack: Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind, Shadcn UI, Supabase.
The Team: My CTO is Kayode. He handles the Backend (Supabase/Python/RAG). I handle the Frontend Vision using AI tools (Cursor/v0).
Current Status:
We have scaffolded a Next.js app in Cursor.
We are using a dark mode "Financial Terminal" aesthetic (JetBrains Mono font, Neon Green accents).
We are strictly mapped to Kayode's backend schema:
funding_flows table (source_institution, destination_sector, amount, evidence_snippet).
market_gaps table (qualitative_gap_level, numeric_gap_estimate).
We are currently running on Mock Data locally because we haven't connected the real API keys yet.
My Role: I am the architect. I prompt you to build components. You write the code.
Current Goal: We are polishing the UI to look "Investor Ready" before pushing to GitHub for Kayode to inspect.
## WORKFLOW RULES (ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE)

1. **The "Definition of Done":**
   Whenever you (the AI) complete a coding task or fix a bug, you MUST end your response by asking:
   > "Task complete. Should I update `AI_CONTEXT.md` to reflect these changes?"

2. **Context Awareness:**
   Before writing new code, always check `AI_CONTEXT.md` to see which Phase we are in. Do not suggest code that contradicts the current Phase.
